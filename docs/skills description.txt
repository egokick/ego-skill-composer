The skills.json file is a configuration file that defines various skills and their associated tasks. Each skill represents a specific functionality or workflow that the automation program can execute. Here's how the skills.json file works and how to construct a new skill:

Structure of skills.json:
1. The file contains a JSON object with a "Skills" array.
2. Each element in the "Skills" array represents a single skill.

Components of a skill:
1. SkillName: A unique identifier for the skill.
2. Description: A brief explanation of what the skill does.
3. Temperature: Controls the randomness of AI responses (if applicable).
4. RepeatCount: Determines how many times the skill should be executed.
5. Tasks: An array of tasks that make up the skill.

Components of a task:
1. Number: The order of the task within the skill.
2. Name: A descriptive name for the task.
3. Mode: Can be "Internal", "AI", or "User", determining how the task is processed.
4. Input: The input data or prompt for the task.
5. SpecialAction: Optional, specifies a special action to be performed.

To construct a new skill:

1. Open the skills.json file.
2. Add a new object to the "Skills" array.
3. Define the SkillName, Description, Temperature, and RepeatCount.
4. Create an array of Tasks, each with Number, Name, Mode, and Input.
5. If needed, add SpecialAction to tasks that require specific functionality.

Example of a new skill:

```json
{
  "SkillName": "New_Skill_Name",
  "Description": "Description of what this skill does",
  "Temperature": 0.7,
  "RepeatCount": 1,
  "Tasks": [
    {
      "Number": 1,
      "Name": "First_Task",
      "Mode": "User",
      "Input": "Please enter some information:"
    },
    {
      "Number": 2,
      "Name": "Second_Task",
      "Mode": "AI",
      "Input": "Process this information: {{Output[1]}}"
    },
    {
      "Number": 3,
      "Name": "Third_Task",
      "Mode": "Internal",
      "Input": "",
      "SpecialAction": "FileWriteOutput"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the skill has three tasks: one that prompts the user for input, another that processes that input using AI, and a third that writes the output to a file.

Remember to use proper JSON syntax, and ensure that your new skill fits logically within the existing structure of the skills.json file.
